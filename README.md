# Perceptrons to Transformers

Clean, minimal implementations of machine learning algorithms built from first principles. 

This repository contains code referenced in my blog series **"From Perceptrons to transformers"** where I document my journey learning AI/ML fundamentals.

## 📂 What's Inside

Each module contains:
- **Core implementation** - Clean, documented code
- **Interactive playground** - Streamlit app for hands-on exploration
- **Jupyter notebook** - Step-by-step walkthrough with visualizations
- **README** - Usage guide and key concepts

### Available Modules

1. **[01-perceptron/](01-perceptron/)** - The first artificial neuron
   
2. **[02-xor-problem/](02-xor-problem/)** - Coming soon

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptrons-to-transformers.git
cd perceptrons-to-transformers

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the perceptron playground
cd 01-perceptron
streamlit run perceptron_playground.py

# Or explore the notebook
jupyter notebook 01_perceptron.ipynb
