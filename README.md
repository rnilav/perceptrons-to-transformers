# Perceptrons to Transformers

Clean, minimal implementations of machine learning algorithms built from first principles. 

This repository contains code referenced in my blog series [From Perceptrons to Transformers]((https://dev.to/rnilav/understanding-perceptrons-the-foundation-of-modern-ai-2g04)) where I document my journey learning AI/ML fundamentals.

## 📂 What's Inside

## 📂 Available Modules

1. [01-perceptron](https://github.com/rnilav/perceptrons-to-transformers/tree/main/01-perceptron)
2. [02-multi-layer-perceptron](https://github.com/rnilav/perceptrons-to-transformers/tree/main/02-multi-layer-perceptron)
3. [03-backpropagation](https://github.com/rnilav/perceptrons-to-transformers/tree/main/03-backpropagation)
4. [04-optimization](https://github.com/rnilav/perceptrons-to-transformers/tree/main/04-optimization)
5. Coming soon

Each module contains:

- **Core implementation** - Clean, documented code
- **Interactive playground** - Streamlit app for hands-on exploration
- **README** - Usage guide and key concepts


## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptrons-to-transformers.git
cd perceptrons-to-transformers

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the cd to each module and run the respective playground
e.g.
cd 01-perceptron
streamlit run perceptron_playground.py


## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy (numerical computing)
- Matplotlib (plotting)
- Plotly (interactive visualizations)
- Streamlit (interactive apps)

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a first principles approach:
- Build everything from scratch (no ML frameworks)
- Understand the math and intuition
- See working code with real examples
- Learn by doing and experimenting
